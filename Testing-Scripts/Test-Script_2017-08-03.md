## Introduction script: 

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the designs, Iâ€™d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for?
    - Can you try to find that information with what you see here?
    - What were you doing the last time you came to the FEC website? Can you try to do that same thing again?
    - What is another reason you might come to the FEC website? Can you accomplish that goal with what you see here?

### Homepage questions
- Imagine that you heard the Commission discussed an issue relevant to your interests in a prior meeting. Where would you look to find that information?

- If you wanted to see when the Commission is meeting next, how would you find that information? 

- What is being discussed at the next commission meeting?

### Data landing page questions
Ok, let's take a look at a design. 

[user opens invision link and shares screen] (https://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/NECTRO1JD#/246322092_Data-Landing-V4)

- Looking at this design but WITHOUT clicking anything, what is your first impression?
- Now try clicking on the Campaign Finance Data menu option at the top, are the options that are displayed there what you expect? 
- Take a look at the trending sections of this design, would you find something like this useful or not? 
    - [If user finds this useful] Why was this useful?
    - [If user finds this NOT useful] Why was this NOT useful?
    - Can you think of any trending options you would rather see here?
- Imagine that you live in Georgia and are interested in finding out what races are happening in your state now. How would you do that?
- How can we test candidate and committee search?*
- How can we test individual contribution search?*

### Compliance map questions
Okay, for this next section, I want to ask you some specific questions about the old FEC website. 

[Direct user to classic.fec.gov]

- Pretend you're working for Karen Handel, who recently ran for Congress in Georgia's sixth district.  If you wanted to know about her reporting deadlines, what would you do?

[If lost or finds another way to do it, tell user that you want to direct their attention to a specific feature and ask how they might use it to answer the question - direct them to the map and ask them to answer the question that way.  Help with reporting and compliance > Compliance map.]

- What is your general impression of this compliance map?

- What do you think this part of the website does well?

- What do you think it could do better, or what would you change about it?

## General questions

That's all the questions I had!

- Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

- Do you have any questions for me?
